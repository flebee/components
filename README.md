<h1 align="center"> Flebee Components </h1>

Flebee Components is a suite designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools and integrations for Angular developers. Our goal is to create high-performance, visually appealing, and easy-to-use components and integrations.

## Essential Features

- **Zoneless Components**: Designed to work without Angular zones, providing better performance.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support**: Optimized for server-side rendering.

## Integrations and Components

### Flebee UI

Beautiful, fast, and modern components, visually inspired by the elegance and functionality of [NextUI](https://nextui.org).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Flebee UI is currently under construction and in beta. Some features may not be fully functional yet.

### Flebee Forms

Flebee Forms is an integration with [Formly](https://formly.dev/) that expands it with signals and a declarative approach to form creation. It allows for complex forms with strong type inference, making form development in Angular more intuitive and efficient.
